# SpatialBacteriaPhageModel

This project gives a framework for simulating several spatially seperated bacteria microcolonies being attacked by a phage invasion.
The code has been used in the publication "Sustainability of spatially distributed bacteria-phage systems" by Rasmus Skytte Eriksen, Kim Sneppen and Namiko Mitarai published in Scientific Reports February 21st 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-59635-7).

To reproduce the data, run the makefile using the command "make".

To preproduce the figures, first run the file "prepareRawData.m" then run the file "generateFigures.m" on a linux system
